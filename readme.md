Dockerless-dex, or simply "Dockerless", is a way to make a BallsDex clone without all the Docker toomfolery that Docker brings. 
Some of those include: 

1. Docker clearing entire dexes
2. Docker not working in some systems
3. No mobile support

And Dockerless simply just fixes those! Obviosuly, Dockerless-Dex is still in early development and there are still some issues, such as missing cards, abilities, fight, and other.

Dockerless currently has these features (for those that feel like it falls short to BallsDex)

1. What-Does-What README markdown file.
2. About 2 to 1 new releases in a day. (sometimes)
3. Mobile support
4. Easy-to-understand method to add balls (and a admin panel, soon)
5. Command to blacklist servers or users.
6. Better admin settings.
7. Settings for status.

This all started due to Wawa hating Docker (and I begging him to give me his old code), which made Wawa open this repository. We were (also) originally working on [BigRat](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat) which I have cancelled until I fully learn Python or something actually useful.

Below are some of the installations for two systems; [Linux](#linux-installation) and [Windows](#windows-installation). MacOS is not listed yet; if you can, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and install the following:
1. git (optional, install manually [here](https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex/releases) if you don't want to use git)
2. nano (optional as well, used for editing text)
3. neovim (optional, used for editing text)
4. python (required, the bot is written in python
5. python-pip (pip for installing the libraries needed by the bot)
6. pyyaml, discord.py, requests (install these with pip (`pip install pyyaml discord.py requests`)

You can install the brew packages with `brew install`.
## Linux Installation
1. First of all, install the needed packages. *(This heavily depends on your package manager, here I'm using `pacman` as an example.)*
```sh
sudo pacman -S python python-pip git neovim nano
```
>[!NOTE]
>`git`, `nano`, and `neovim` are __optional__ as `git` will be used for cloning the repository. `nano` and `neovim` are used for editing text through the terminal; you will probably have those three already installed, depending on your distribution or previous actions.

2. After installing the packages, clone the repository with `git` or download it manually from [here](https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex/releases).
```sh
cd "$HOME" ; git clone https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex ; cd "$HOME/dockerless-dex"
# The command above will send you to your home directory then clone the GitHub repository then send you inside the folder. The ";" will run the command once the previous one finishes.
```
3. Once you clone the GitHub repository, you can edit the `config.yml` file with your prefered text editor:
```sh
nvim config.yml # Press "i" to go into instert mode, to exit press ESC to exit insert mode; write ":wq" to exit. (write, quit)

# Or:
nano config.yml # To exit, press CTRL + X.

# Once you're inside the file, edit it as it is required for your bot to turn on.
```

4. Now you can make a VENV *(Virtual ENViroment)* with python to install the dependencies.
```sh
python -m venv .venv # Creates the .venv folder.

source ".venv/bin/activate" # Activates the .venv folder. This will only work if you're using BASH. To know which one you're using, run "which $SHELL" in your terminal.

pip install discord.py pyyaml requests # Installs dependencies.
```
>[!TIP]
>Your package manager may contain the dependencies. E.G.:
>```sh
>yay -S python-yaml python-discord-py python-requests
>```

>[!NOTE]
>Creating the VENV isn't required but I still \*personally\* recommend **you** to make it.

5. Now that you got everything ready, make sure that:
   - You have everything under Bot -> Priviliged Gateway Intents ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1204312915432439840/1206397619564314624/image.png?ex=65dbdc56&is=65c96756&hm=e4ddfb943bde269418170012b27f139380becd18c4e32b929e7d1a023aac16d2&)
   - Have a correct invite link. ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1204312915432439840/1206397813412335626/image.png?ex=65dbdc84&is=65c96784&hm=6979555fce3770d1f2c4aff7aae8925a8eefee8fa63b88c5e57b42833628939e&)
     - You get that all that done [here](https://discord.com/developers).

7. You can find some documentaion on how to add collectables [here](https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex/tree/main/ymls). The link mentioned also works as a guide for the YML files.

8. If everything you did turned out well, you can *finally* run the bot.

```sh
python dex.py # Believing you're still in the dockerless-dex/ folder.
```

## Windows Installation
1. First of all, download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or the microsoft store.
2. Download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) **(OPTIONAL)**
   - `git clone https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex.git`
   - If you don't want to use git, you can download the repository manually from [here](https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex/releases).
3. After cloning *(or downloading the zip from the link provided)*, go to where you cloned the repository *(usually your profile folder)* and open the `config.yml` file with your favorite text editor.
4. Install the dependencies with `pip`.
   - `pip install discord.py pyyaml asyncio requests` 
5. Now that you got everything ready, make sure that:
   - You have everything under Bot -> Priviliged Gateway Intents ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1204312915432439840/1206397619564314624/image.png?ex=65dbdc56&is=65c96756&hm=e4ddfb943bde269418170012b27f139380becd18c4e32b929e7d1a023aac16d2&)

6. You can find some documentaion on how to add collectables [here](https://github.com/wascertified/dockerless-dex/tree/main/ymls). The link mentioned also works as a guide for the YML files.
7. And you're done! Now you can run the bot if you've done everything correctly.
   - `python dex.py`
## Mobile installation
1. Copy the url link
2. Go to replit
3. Paste the link
4. If it says "Add a run commmand" type in `python dex.py`
5. Edit the stuff said in Windows installation
6. Run and your done!
